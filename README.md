# Boredom Buster

This is a quick side project that I created to find some inspiration when bored.

It randomly chooses a fun activity and a fitting duration for you get up and have some fun.


# Installation

Run the following command to install all needed dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

To start the application in development mode, execute the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will then be available at http://localhost:5173.
